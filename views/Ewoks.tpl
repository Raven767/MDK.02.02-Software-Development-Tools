<h3> Culture </h3>
<p>By the time of the Galactic Civil War, the Ewoks had reached a level of civilization where they engaged in religious, artistic, medical, and even political activities, and spoke in their own native tongue of Ewokese. Nevertheless,
they still focused most of their energies on the daily provision of food. They had acquired knowledge of pottery, hunting, the construction of complex wooden structures and the creation of fire. While most of their lives would be spent in the treetops,
several members of the tribe would be required to venture out on the forest floor to forage for berries, gather herbs, and hunt. During warm summer months, some Ewoks stayed in fishing villages or hunting and farming lodges on the forest floor.
Utilizing ponies and bordoks to haul loads of supplies between settlements, they nonetheless kept their guard up for ferocious predators and other sentient creatures such as the Yuzzums.</p>

<p>Ewoks lived high among the trees of the forest moon of Endor, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The canopies of the great trees were filled with watchers who could alert the tribe of approaching gorax or condor dragons,
and could use gliders to patrol the lands beyond their local village. Bachelors, on the other hand, often lived on the ground and kept watch for even greater dangers such as Duloks, who often emerged from the swamps to prey on Ewoks and lantern birds.
The Ewoks were a deeply spiritual people. They revered the surrounding giant trees and believed themselves to be descendants of the "Great Tree," a sacred tree in the forests. The conifer trees where Ewoks lived were also fire resistant,
and served as a natural insect repellent. </p>
<h3> Behind the scenes </h3>
<p> George Lucas intended that a primitive race should overthrow the Empire in what was intended at that time to be the final episode, and had originally planned to use Wookiees, but decided against it after it had been established that 
Chewbacca was already proficient with technology at that point. His answer was to create a new race called Ewoks, which is "Wookiee" with the syllables reversed (and altered to resemble the name of a Native American people).
In the audio commentary for the 2004 re-release of Return of the Jedi, as well as the documentary Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy, Lucas also cited the Viet Cong as being the primary inspiration for the Ewoks, particularly 
their defeat of the Galactic Empire.</p>

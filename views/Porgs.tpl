<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>Porgs were a species of non-sentient birds. They were stocky in nature, with two short wings, flat, beakless faces, and two webbed feet.
   They could also run quite swiftly on the ground and were good at maneuvering into small spaces. 
   Porgs favored colder environments. Porgs apparently understood certain linguistic terms. When they overheard Rey refer to Chewbacca as "Chewie," they mistook it to be the word chewy, leading them to wonder whether Chewbacca would serve as her food.</p>

<h3>Behavior</h3>
<p>These hypercurious, cliff-dwelling creatures were found throughout the islands of the planet Ahch-To. They were capable of performing controlled dives into the sea, where they fetched fish.
Porgs loved water, both to drink and to play in. They also loved tasting new things. Porgs had strong natural camouflaging abilities, as well as many interesting calls, ranging from burbles to squeaks to song. They crooned a special song when they were pleased. However, they could also be completely silent when necessary. Despite their curious nature, they could be quite shy if they felt threatened. Porgs, both wild and domesticated alike, were unusually smitten by human objects, and found shiny objects very fascinating. If their curiosity ran unchecked, they could wreak havoc.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Porgs evolved from seabirds on Ahch-To. Considered quite tasty by some species, they were sometimes hunted by the resident Lanai as well as visitors to Ahch-To. At the time of the First Order/Resistance War, when Jedi Master Luke Skywalker threw his lightsaber off a cliff, two porgs investigated the weapon. The birds nearly activated the weapon, before they were scared off by Rey. Shortly afterwards, another porg watched in curiosity from its nest as the Jedi Master spearfished from an island cliff. Rey found the porgs to be helpful to her Jedi training after she used the Force to catch one in midair in order to retrieve the lightsaber it had snatched. Finding that the porg's flock was visibly fascinated by her power, Rey promised them all "a turn." While staying on Ahch-To, the Wookiee Chewbacca roasted two porgs for supper. A few of the birds stared at him before he could take a bite, but Chewbacca scared them off. When Chewbacca landed on Ahch-To, he considered porgs as a tasty treat, but found it hard to kill the winged creatures when the pack turned their sad eyes on him.</p>

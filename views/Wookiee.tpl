<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>Wookiees were a species of tall, hairy humanoids that were native to the planet Kashyyyk. 
The most notable member of this species was the warrior Chewbacca, Han Solo's best friend and co-pilot, who played a vital role in the Clone Wars during the defense of Kashyyyk, the Galactic Civil War by aiding the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Galactic Empire, and the war against the First Order. 
They were quite strong, and were known to rip people's arms out of their sockets when provoked. 
Though being from a temperate planet better known for its swamps and forests, they were able to be comfortable on icy worlds such as Ilum and Hoth without any protective clothing, including gloves and boots.</p>

<h3>History </h3>
<p>Wookiees originated on the Mid Rim forest planet of Kashyyyk. 
In the ancient past, they invented and crafted weapons that fired poisoned darts and arrows. During the Clone Wars and the reign of King Grakchawwaa, the Wookiees remained fiercely loyal to the Galactic Republic and fought alongside them in several star systems. 
Towards the end of the conflict, Wookiee forces also defended their homeworld from a Separatist invasion with the help of Galactic Republic forces led by Jedi Master Yoda, who had good relations with them.</p>
